###### Aesthetic Image Captioning For Photography Critique


**Task**

Through this project, we will explore the potential for image captioning models to provide substantive critique of photographers images. Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC), sometimes also referred to as Aesthetic Critique Captioning, is the process of producing a caption critiquing an image. Where standard Image Captioning will take an image as input, and output a caption describing the contents of that image, AIC will similarly take an image as input, but then produce a caption critiquing the aesthetic quality of that image.  This task can be utilized in applications like aesthetics-based image enhancement and photography cameras.

One of the challenges of this task is the quality of data that the models are to be trained on. When it comes to standard Image Captioning, images can be fairly grounded in an observable ground truth. While a single image may be described in multiple different ways, there is no disputing what is in that image. When it comes to AIC however, peopleâ€™s subjective critiques are much more visible. One person may like an image for a particular reason, while another person may dislike the photo for that same reason. When there is not enough data to smooth out the variance in these critiques, the dataset may become noisy, causing the model to not perform as well as it could. In this regard, the task at hand will be twofold. Simply developing a powerful model alone will not be sufficient, but a good dataset will need to be used in conjunction with a good model to produce effective results in the field of Aesthetic Image Captioning.
