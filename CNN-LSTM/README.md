###### Aesthetic Image Captioning For Photography Critique


* Use a CNN-LSTM architecture to caption images with aesthetic critique
* Will initially train on the PCCD dataset as it is small and will train faster
* Then will train on AVA-Captions and/or RPCD dataset to see what performance boosts can be achieved from different datasets
